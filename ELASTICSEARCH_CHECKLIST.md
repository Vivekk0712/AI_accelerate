## 🔍 Verification Checklist

### System Health
```bash
# Run these commands and verify output:

# 1. Check Elasticsearch connection
python -c "from elasticsearch_client import init_elasticsearch, get_index_stats; import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); init_elasticsearch(cloud_id=os.getenv('ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID'), api_key=os.getenv('ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY')); print('✅ Connected'); print(get_index_stats())"

# 2. Check server health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 3. Check index stats
python -c "from elasticsearch_client import get_index_stats, init_elasticsearch; import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv(); init_elasticsearch(cloud_id=os.getenv('ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID'), api_key=os.getenv('ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY')); print(get_index_stats())"
```
